# Project Idea: Online Bookstore

Description: Build an online bookstore application that allows users to browse, search, and purchase books. The application will have features for managing books, customer accounts, and order processing.

## Features

### Book Management

Allow administrators to add, update, and delete books from the inventory.
Include functionality to assign categories, authors, and other metadata to books.

### User Management

Provide user registration and authentication mechanisms.
Implement user roles (e.g., admin, customer) to control access and functionality.

### Book Searching and Browsing

Implement search functionality to allow users to search for books based on title, author, or category.
Provide filters and sorting options to refine search results.
Display book details including cover image, description, price, and availability.

### Shopping Cart and Checkout

Allow customers to add books to their shopping cart.
Provide functionality for updating quantities and removing items from the cart.
Implement a secure checkout process for customers to enter shipping and payment details.

### Order Management

Enable administrators to view and manage customer orders.
Include features to process orders, update order status, and generate invoices.

### Reviews and Ratings

Allow customers to leave reviews and ratings for books.
Display average ratings and reviews on book detail pages.

### Integration with Payment Gateway

Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process payments securely.
### User Dashboard

Provide a personalized dashboard for customers to manage their profile, orders, and wishlist.

### Security

Implement security measures like password hashing, CSRF protection, and secure communication using HTTPS.

### API Documentation

Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or Spring Rest Docs.
This project will allow you to utilize various Spring Boot features like Spring MVC for handling requests, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, Spring Data JPA for database operations, and other Spring modules as needed.

Remember to plan and design your project structure and database schema before starting the implementation. This project will give you hands-on experience in building a complete web application using Spring Boot 2 and Java 8.
